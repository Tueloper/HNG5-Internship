The HNG5-Internship, every task and documentation will be done here.

### Tasks
+ Day 1
    - Task 1: sign up for GitHub. Create a personal repository. Commit a file. Pull the file. Change stuff. Commit again. Check that you have a profile image set here. If you do not have a blog, start one on blogspot, WordPress, medium or anywhere else you want. After all is complete, add this icon to your status here: :hatching_chick: by the time we start, all those without the above will not start with us.
    
    - Task 2: Join the #design-stage1 channel. Use Figma to design yourself a home page. Your page must follow a particular format: Your picture on the top left corner. Links below your picture About, Blog, Projects. Below that are three icons with links to your social media. On the right (separated by a line from the left section), will be some welcoming information for you. *Everyone* will need to do this. The mentors will give you feedback on your design, however, I will be the final judge. Till your design is accepted, you cannot start the internship. Pay attention to alignment, colors and other important parts of design.
    
    - Task 3: a) Have a registered and accepted bug found and in the spreadsheet  

              b) Have a write up on your blog where you link to timbu.com

              c) Enter your name on the hng.tech site.  

              Once all those three are complete, you are eligible for Stage 2.

              However, if you are able to write a blog post in a unique domain that no one else has used, you get an automatic                              promotion to stage 2.
