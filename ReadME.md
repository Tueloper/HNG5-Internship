The HNG5-Internship, every task and documentation will be done here.

### Tasks
+ Day 1
    - Task 1: sign up for GitHub. Create a personal repository. Commit a file. Pull the file. Change stuff. Commit again. Check that you have a profile image set here. If you do not have a blog, start one on blogspot, WordPress, medium or anywhere else you want. After all is complete, add this icon to your status here: :hatching_chick: by the time we start, all those without the above will not start with us.
    
    - Task 2: Join the #design-stage1 channel. Use Figma to design yourself a home page. Your page must follow a particular format: Your picture on the top left corner. Links below your picture About, Blog, Projects. Below that are three icons with links to your social media. On the right (separated by a line from the left section), will be some welcoming information for you. *Everyone* will need to do this. The mentors will give you feedback on your design, however, I will be the final judge. Till your design is accepted, you cannot start the internship. Pay attention to alignment, colors and other important parts of design.
